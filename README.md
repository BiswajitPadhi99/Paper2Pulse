Official implementation of **"Paper2Pulse: An End-to-End Framework for Paper ECG Digitization, Classification, and On-Device Deployment"** (KDD 2026).

## 🔬 Overview
**Paper2Pulse** is an end-to-end framework for transforming degraded paper ECG photographs into accurate diagnostic predictions. Our system bridges the gap between paper-based ECG archives—common in resource-limited healthcare settings—and modern AI-powered cardiac analysis.
